# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I mostly used the w3schools website that was referenced in the text given to understnad in  detail what the code was trying to do.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The first challenge was learning new syntax that regards JS, HTML and CSS but because of how similar JS is to Java, I used previous knowledge to overcome that particular challenge. The second challenge I had to go through was trying to use images which did not work out because after research I figured that Xfinity which is the WIFI I use had blocked certain features and somehow Glitch Assets were also affected. The third challenge I faced was when I tried to use the random method to create a list of 8 random elements that would make the game less predictable. However, I believe my syntax was wrong as Glitch notified me of an error that I could not resolve just yet. I had a hard time understanding all the functions but I studied the code more in depth and it became easier to see what was happening. It was a challenge also, not knowing fully why each code had to go to either CSS, JS or HTML as well but with more and more instances, a pattern was observed and it became easier to see why they went to each part of the code. My biggest challenge was trying to push the code to Github. I have watched a lot of videos multiple times and I still get an error and I believe I can get through this with more research.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How deeper does web development go?
How similar is web development to Android app development?
Could other languages like python be used instead of Javascript and CSS for the backend?
What other resources can be used in place of Glitch?
Is there a way to keep all features fixed and not move in relation to the size of the screen?
How can I link other webpages?
Are there standard rules to web design?
How can I add pictures and videos to web pages?
How can I align text as I please when developing web pages.
How to push code easily using github?








4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I was thinking of adding a sound to signify the user fails and to indicate that the game ended or a happy sound and some confetti if the user completed the game and won. 
I could also add pause and play buttons that would pause the game say the user has to go attend to other things.
I was thinking of a situation with levels where the levels increase the number of sound buttons.
Another feature that could be added was making it available in turns between a user1 and user2 where the fastest to complete the game wins.
The game could also start by picking difficulty levels where the harder the difficulty level the faster the sounds play before the user has a chance to pick button.
